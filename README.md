# Module5-Challenge

# Instructions
This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:

# Prepare the data.

Run the provided package dependency and data imports, and then merge the mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames into a single DataFrame.

# Generate summary statistics.
Create a DataFrame of summary statistics. Remember, there is more than one method to produce the results you're after, so the method you use is less important than the result.

# Create bar charts and pie charts.

Generate two bar charts. Both charts should be identical and show the total total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen throughout the study.

Generate two pie charts. Both charts should be identical and show the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.

# Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Then, calculate the quartiles and IQR, and determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens. Use the following substeps:

# Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
Select a single mouse that was treated with Capomulin, and generate a line plot of tumor volume versus time point for that mouse.
Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.

# Calculate correlation and regression.
Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.
Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.

# Submit your final analysis.
